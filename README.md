#TrendDataMapper


## About
TrendDataMapper is a D3 / DataMaps-based project template/library for making multiple tabbed or small-multiple maps. Beware that styles in the demo folder are currently needed for proper functionality of src. (See TODO list).

### TODO
1. Move CSS out of demo index to resources and vendor dir as appropriate -- some of the CSS is important for basic funcionality.
