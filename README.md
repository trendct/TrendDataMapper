#TrendDataMapper

## About
TrendDataMapper is a *very early-stage* D3 / DataMaps-based project library-to-be for making multiple tabbed or small-multiple maps. 

## Usage
The demo has been moved to its own repo: https://github.com/trendct/MapProjectTemplate

##### Beware
1. There's no documentation or even a full version yet.
2. We're still separating some of the project-specific code from the library code

##### TODO
1. Move CSS out of demo index to resources and vendor dir as appropriate -- some of the CSS is important for basic funcionality.
2. Make some decisions about the popup sizing and positioning
3. Add pass-through to datamaps categorical coloring
